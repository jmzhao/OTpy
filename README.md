# OTpy

OTpy is a fast Python package for models and algorithms in Optimality Theory (OT), 
alone with a simple easy-to-use user interface. 

It implements Constraint Demotion (CD) and Fusional Reduction (FRed) for strict ranking model, 
and Generalized Iterative Scaling (GIS), Sequential Conditional GIS (SCGIS) and Nonlinear Conjugate Gradient (NCG) 
for Maximum Entropy model (Maxent).

The code is written in Python 3.3.3. 
The graphic interface is based on Tkinter within it.
The generation of Hasse diagraph is supported by [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/) 
and Python package [pydot](https://github.com/nlhepler/pydot).
